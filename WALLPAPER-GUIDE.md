# Desktop Background Aesthetic Guide

## Why It Matters

A transparent terminal is only as beautiful as what's behind it. Your desktop wallpaper becomes part of your coding environment — the canvas for your terminal window.

The Everlife theme is designed to let your wallpaper shine through while maintaining readability and visual harmony.

## Recommended Styles

### For Strong Transparency (15-25%)

Best for maximum aesthetic impact. Your wallpaper is clearly visible.

| Style | Examples | Why It Works |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Dark gradients | Deep blues, forest greens, charcoal | Text remains readable, creates depth |
| Space/cosmos | Stars, nebulae, galaxies | Dark tones + organic shapes |
| Nature scenes | Forests, mountains, oceans | Calm, organic, timeless |
| Abstract art | Soft, muted colors, gradients | Minimal distraction |

### For Light Transparency (25-50%)

More subtle transparency. Better for focused work sessions.

| Style | Examples | Why It Works |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| Minimalist | Simple shapes, clean lines | Professional, distraction-free |
| Photography | Landscapes, cityscapes | Personal touch without clutter |
| Anime art | Soft colors, scenic views | Aesthetic, calming |

## Animated Wallpapers

Animated wallpapers create dynamic, living terminals. The Everlife theme's transparency makes your terminal feel alive.

## Opacity by Use Case

| Activity | Recommended Opacity | Reason |
|----------|--------------------| ------------|
| Coding sessions | 20-30% | Balance focus and aesthetic |
| AI assistant work | 15-25% | Visual distinction |
| Terminal-heavy work | 30-50% | More contrast for text |
| Aesthetic showcase | 10-20% | Maximum transparency |

## Tips for Best Results

### Readability

1. **Darker wallpapers** = better text contrast
2. **Avoid busy patterns** in the center of your screen
3. **Soft gradients** work better than sharp contrasts
4. **Test with your actual work** — code should be readable

### Aesthetics

1. **Match color temperature** — warm wallpapers with warm terminal colors
2. **Consider time of day** — darker for night, lighter for day
3. **Seasonal wallpapers** — change with the seasons
4. **Personal meaning** — use wallpapers that inspire you

### Workflow

1. **Position windows thoughtfully** — let wallpaper elements show through
2. **Use multiple desktops** — different wallpapers for different work modes
3. **Adjust opacity per task** — more transparent for casual, less for focus
