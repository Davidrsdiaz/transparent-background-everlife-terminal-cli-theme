# Codex CLI (OpenAI) - Inherits Terminal Colors

OpenAI's Codex CLI automatically uses your terminal's configured colors. No additional setup needed!

## Why This Is Good

✅ Codex inherits your terminal theme automatically
✅ Just install one of our terminal themes
✅ Codex will match perfectly

## About Codex CLI

Codex CLI is OpenAI's official command-line coding agent.

- **Powered by OpenAI models**: GPT-4, o1, etc.
- **Agentic capabilities**: Edit files, run commands, debug
- **MCP support**: Model Context Protocol integration
- **Sandbox mode**: Safe command execution

## Installation

```bash
# Install Codex CLI
npm install -g @openai/codex

# Install terminal theme
cp ../../terminals/ghostty/config ~/.config/ghostty/config
```

## No Config Needed

Codex doesn't have a separate theme configuration. It uses the ANSI colors from your terminal, which are already configured in our terminal themes.

## Fork with Theming: Every Code

For a Codex fork with custom theme support, see [Every Code](../every-code/).
